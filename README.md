# Gia Portfolio

## Description
This repo is for a personal portfolio for a professional marketing and design manager. The goal of this project is to create a skeleton web application that the user can add further projects to with minimal difficulty, keeping their portfolio up-to-date. 

Having the website display the project images and captions as well as other items in a pleasing way to many different kinds of projects will be a challenge. 

My initial idea is for the user to simply upload their project data(images, captions, etc.) to a JSON file and push the change up to the repo. This gives the user control to update and personally customize their own portfolio without having to do any in-depth coding(or really any coding at all).

I began with just two of the user's professional projects so that the CSS could be formatted to fit more than one project while being able to display two projects with different items pleasingly and correctly.
